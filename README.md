# VoiSee 10.0.0

VoiSee is a WinUI 3 application for real-time voice processing, SoundBoard playback into a virtual microphone, scenes, presets, global hotkeys, themes, and non-destructive sound editing.

## Sound Editor highlights

- Centered timeline editor opened from `Edit Track` or the sound context menu.
- Drag directly across the waveform to select a fragment.
- `Trim Outside` keeps the selection and removes everything outside it.
- `Cut Selection` removes the selected fragment and joins the remaining audio.
- Minimum selection and remaining sound length: 0.2 seconds.
- Preview uses the current `SoundBoard → Headphones` volume and never routes to the virtual microphone.
- External SoundBoard/Scene sounds and normal global hotkeys are isolated while the editor is open.
- Live waveform feedback for volume gain, normalize, fade in, fade out, and distortion.
- `Save File` updates the current library item.
- `Save as` creates unique names such as `[edit]`, `[edit 2]`, and `[edit 3]`.
- The editor owns mouse-wheel scrolling while open; the SoundBoard behind it does not scroll.
